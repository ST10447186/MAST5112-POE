ChangeLog:
Feature: Average Price by Course
Implemented functionality to calculate and display the average price of menu items for each course on the home screen.
Feature: Separate Add Menu Items Screen
Created a dedicated screen for adding and removing menu items, moving this functionality away from the home screen.
Feature: Persistent Menu Array
Menu items are now stored in a dynamically managed array, allowing for addition and removal of items.
Feature: Filter Menu by Course
Added a new screen to allow guests to filter menu items by course (e.g., starters, mains, desserts).
Refactoring for Modularity
Extracted reusable components and functions into separate files to improve code organization.
Bug Fixes and Optimization
Addressed any issues reported in Part 2 feedback, such as validation for form inputs and better handling of state updates.
